If in the 50s or 60s, some person somewhere in Western Europe said "I
am Hungarian", the first reaction of the surroundings would probably
have sounded thus: "Hungarian? Then Puskás and football... and
6:3...", and immediately the avenues of communication would have been
opened.  The first reflex at the end of the 80s is more often "the
Polgár sisters... and chess... and the Olympic Games in Seoul..."  How
have you experienced this unaccustomed popularity?

Perhaps ill will does not always hide behind reservations and doubts.
Do people not fear that you traet your children as chess pieces or
puppets?

There is a lot of truth in that.  It's why in September six-year-old
children happily go to school but already by Christmas little of their
joy remains.  I believe you that one can't shape a creative person
without their own action, and couldn't guide your children to their
peak against their will.  But it still doesn't follow that such a
child really does become happy, or that they stay content throughout
their life.

Allow me now to ask about personal matters.  What sort of life and
world view do you have

What sort of man do you consider yourself?
