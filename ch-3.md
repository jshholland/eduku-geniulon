## Why chess?

> Who considers it mere art, is a bad chess player!
> Who considers it mere sport, is also a bad chess player!
> Finally there are those, according to who chess is a science.
> Those are not the least bad chess players.

M. Najdorf

> The mental activity is perhaps the greatest pleasure in life; and the chess is a kind of mental activity.

S. Tarrasch

> The chess is the whole world to me, but the world consists not only of chess.

> Why have you and your wife chosen chess as the object of your experiment?

When we started the practical foundation of our genius-pedagogy theory, first we planned to experiment with mathematics, chess and foreign languages.
Under influence of several factors, we have finally decided in favor of the chess.
I was motivated mainly by the following factors:

We wanted to prove our theory in the field of mental creation, because comparable experiments took place neither in Hungary, nor abroad.

Within this we have chosen the chess, because we became convinced that here - in comparison with other areas - you can more quickly achieve a measurable result and in particular, because here the system of valuation is more delineated, more fixed, therefore more objective and accurate.
This allows to more unambiguously prove the success or failure of the experiment.
We have decided correctly, because at the time we did not even imagine, how many difficulties we would have to overcome in our work.
If even to the daughters and to ourselves we would not be able to unambiguously show, to prove the result, the attacks would be much more damaging our work.
At the chessboard one can more easily objectively prove who is better, stronger in the competition.
