When we started the practical foundation of our genipedagogia theory, first we planned to experiment with mathematics, chess and foreign languages.
The influence of several factors, we have decided to end in favor of the chess.
Motivated me mainly the following factors:

Our theory we wanted to show in the field of mental creation, because comparable experiments took place neither in Hungary, nor abroad.

Within this we have chosen the chess, because we were convinced that here - in comparison with other areas - you can more quickly achieve a measurable result and in particular, because here the system of valuation is more delineated, more fixed, then more objective and accurate.
This makes it unambiguously prove the success or failure of the experiment.
We decidids exactly, because then we do not even imagetis, how many difficulties we have to overcome in our work.
If even to the daughters and to ourselves we would not be able to unambiguously show, to prove the result, the attacks would be much more malhelpintaj our work.
At the chessboard was more easily objectively prove who is better, stronger in the competition.
